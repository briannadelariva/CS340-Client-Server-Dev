# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the 
# dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? 

Creating maintainable code involves having clear naming conventions, consistent coding styles, and incorporating comments for improved readability, as well as frequent debugging. With the CRUD Python module, its database operations promotes reusability and adaptability, while its main structure simplifies maintenance. In the future, this python module may be used as a reference for how to successfully create CRUD using python.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
As a computer scientist, I approach problems meticulously by first understanding the requirements, breaking down the problem into smaller components, and designing simplistic solutions. For Grazioso Salvare's database and dashboard needs, this involved data analysis, interactive design for the dashboard, and the implementation of efficient CRUD operations for the database. Prioritizing readability, maintainability, and iterative development, I used existing tools like the CRUD Python module to expedite development and ensure long-term viability.

# How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
In this project, I applied a well-rounded approach, integrating data analysis, interactive dashboard design, and database operations. Unlike previous assignments that might have focused on using solely mongo databases and the terminal, this project required a user-friendly approach with an interactive dashboard and visual charts. In the future, I would continue combining interactive designs, emphasizing clear visualization of data and turning specific needs into user-friendly layouts. 

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists analyze complex problems, design algorithms, develop software, and create software/database solutions. Their work is crucial as it enables data analysis, data visualization, and user-friendly experiences. Within Grazioso Salvare, my work on this project would enhance their operations by providing efficient data management through a well-designed database dashboard and aiding in informed decision-making with a user-friendly interactive dashboard, ultimately improving the company's overall efficiency.
